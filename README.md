# TiltQuest

TiltQuest is a ball game where the goal is to navigate the ball through the maze by tilting it and reaching the exit point to escape the maze.

The journey through the maze is made more challenging by effects triggered upon the ball's contact with certain objects. These negative effects can:
- Reduce the field of vision by narrowing the light beam.
- Change the direction of gravity, complicating movement.

The player's performance is measured with a timer, allowing comparison of progress and improvement over time or against other players.
